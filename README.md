# Sudoku-solver


**Project Description**

This project implements a Sudoku puzzle solver using constraint satisfaction techniques and backtracking search. The solver models Sudoku as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and applies heuristic-driven search strategies to efficiently find valid solutions for standard 9×9 boards.


🔍 **Core Features**

Solves standard 9×9 Sudoku puzzles

Uses backtracking search with constraint checking

Incorporates heuristics such as:

Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)

Forward Checking

Detects invalid or unsolvable boards

Clean, modular implementation for extensibility


🧠 **Algorithms & Concepts**

Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)

Backtracking recursion

Variable selection heuristics

Pruning via constraint propagation


The implementation emphasizes algorithmic correctness, efficiency, and clarity, making it suitable for coursework, algorithm demonstrations, and further experimentation with search heuristics.
